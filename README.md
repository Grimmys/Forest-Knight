# Forest-Knight

A simple adventure platformer game written in Python using the Arcade library

This is a simple game project that is being actively developed by me. I wish to finish this by the end of this year.
This repository too will be updated on a regular basis with new files, maps, code, assets once I get everything set up

For this game, I have the following plans:

* Use the [Arcade Library](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade) to develop this game
* Using the [Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) to create all the different levels of this game
* Use royalty-free game assets from: [Kenney NL](https://kenney.nl) and [Games Art 2d](https://www.gameart2d.com). These sites provided assets like players, enemies, platforms, GUIs, tilesets, audio etc
* Lastly, Package the app to an executable file using the [Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase) library from the BeeWare Project.
