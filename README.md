The game is still in its alpha stages and is being actively developed by me. For this game I am:

* Using the [Arcade Library](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade) to develop this game
* Using the [Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) to create all the different levels of this game
* Using royalty-free game assets from: [Kenney NL](https://kenney.nl) and [Games Art 2d](https://www.gameart2d.com). These sites provided assets like players, enemies, platforms, GUIs, tilesets, audio etc.

## Things left to complete
