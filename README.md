# Forest-Knight
A simple adventure platformer game written in Python using the Arcade library

This is a simple game project that is being actively developed by me. I wish to finish this by the end of this year.
This repository too will be updated on a regular basis with new files, maps, code, assets once I get everything set up

Open source software this game will utilize:
* The [Arcade Library](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade) for Python which is a newer Pythonic game engine
* The [Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) which will be used to create all the different levels of this game
* Free game assets from: [Kenney NL](https://kenney.nl) and [Games Art 2d](https://www.gameart2d.com). These sites provided assets like players, enimies, platforms, GUIs, tilesets, etc
* Although I don't know how to use it, I might integrate some kind of physics using the [Pymunk Physics Engine](https://github.com/viblo/pymunk). But that is in the very distant future.
