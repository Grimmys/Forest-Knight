# CREDITS to all the external sources that have been used to make this game

The game uses royalty-free assets from around the web and I have made my maximum effort to go through all the licenses and make sure I am not violating anyone's hard work for my profit (which I won't be making anyways since this is a free game that is a personal project). I am only human and may be mistaken and therefore will be certainly happy to stop the usage of any asset used in the game if I am notified of any unauthorized usage.
